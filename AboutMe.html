    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>My name is Maria Viterbo... And no, my name is not as short as you think. My full name is Maria Marla Dyan Santiago Viterbo. I am 22 years old. And I love web development.</p>
        
    <p>Ironically, this is the first website I have created from scratch on my own. I was always fond of coding in HTML and CSS because of their ability to give me <em>anything</em> I want. No, I am not spoiled. I meant HTML and CSS allows me to actually create something I only see through my imagination. This feeling of satisfaction started during Friendster times, a website where you can manipulate texts and add background to your profile. I loved learning new code.</p>
    
    <p>When Friendster was converted to a website full of games, I moved on to Tumblr... Here, I would take free themes created by other people to make my page look as awesome as me. I also learnt more than just the font tag, bold tag, and background element etc. I learnt the marquee element, the link elements, img elements and so on... I was addicted to changing my theme everyday as if I was changing my clothes. On top of that, I would edit the existing HTML code and play around with it until my page look appealing to me.</p>
    
    <p>Once I was introduced to Facebook in 2009, I wasn't able to edit any code because Facebook sets the theme and everything for you, nor did I search on the web if I can actually code something myself. Consequently, I ended up choosing a course at university that I did not particularly enjoy. Of course, when I found out that I could, I immediately dropped out and shifted to Computer Science.</p>
    
    <h3>University</h3>
    <p>I am a third year Computer Science student at Brunel University of London. I am expected to graduate sometime in July 2018. Truth be told, they did not teach any HTML, CSS, Javascript in school. In fact, my university only taught us one programming language - Java.</p>
    
    <p>During second year, we had to choose a project to work on. There were 6 of us in a group and we decided that we would create an digital version of the Marauder's Map. This map was first mentioned in Harry Potter, where you can see someone's location real time. For security reasons, the app allows the users to enable/disable location and block it from a particular person in their friends list.</p>
        
    <p>I had many different tasks. Firstly, I did some research on exisiting map apps such as Waze and Google map to gain ideas of the features that users like/dislike. I was also involved in researching different servers to find which is most suitable for our app. However, my main task was to link the map to the app and put a marker on the user's current location. After that, I created the test plans and helped with the website.</p>

    <p>My final year project is quite similar except that it is an individual work. I am currently working on an app suitable for nurses and doctors. However, it can be used by busy people in general, or in occassions where someone cannot text e.g. while driving or in a meeting.</p>
